# SpaceDuster

Made for the NASA Space Apps 2019 Challenge

Space Duster uses a simulated low earth orbit environment. Orbital mechanics parameters are base on a 375km AGL orbit similar to the ISS. Time and relative distances have been adjusted to make for a more fun game. The player takes on the role of a cleaning satellite that can capture space debris and use it to produce thrust to extend time on station while cleaning the orbit.

Right and left arrows expend fuel to raise or lower orbit. In orbit things at higher orbit are going slower so more left. Lower than you are faster so go right. You (the ball) stay in the center.

Red boxes are space junk you want to capture and turn into fuel. Green ones are satellites that you don't want to hit. Size of box is related to mass of space junk.

Hitting a satellite or running out of fuel ends the game. Try to clean as much junk as possible and don't miss too much.

You can cheat and give yourself more fuel with F. For now...
